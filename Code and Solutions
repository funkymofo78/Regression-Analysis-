#the points on the qq plot are close to the line indicating that the residuals are normally distributed.

#On average we would expect the weight to increase by 45kg for every 1 metre increase in height.
#H0: Regression coefficent = 0
#H1: slope is not 0
#p-value < 2.2x10-16 < 0.05, reject null hypothesis and conclude there is a significant slope i.e. a significant
#linear relationship between height and weight.
#R-sq=73%, 73% of the variation in Weight is being explained by this model (height), which is quite a high
#Rˆ2 value.
